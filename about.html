                        <p>Hello! I’m Matt Breen. I spent over a decade at Constant Contact, most recently as a Group Product Manager, and I’m currently consulting on product-led growth at Thryv. My love for product started early: from building with Legos as a kid, to modding games as a teen, to designing and developing my own small-scale, and never finished video games today. I’m drawn to systems, iteration, and the satisfaction of seeing something I built come to life.</p>
                        <p>Outside of work, I’m either in the kitchen trying out new recipes or planning the next trip with my wife (who does most of the planning). Born and raised 45min outside of the city, I’ve now lived in Boston for over 10 years in many of the different neighborhoods.</p>
