                        <p>Hello! I’m Matt Breen. I spent over a decade at Constant Contact, most recently as a Group Product Manager, and I’m currently consulting on product-led growth at Thryv. My love for product started early: from building with Legos as a kid, to modding games as a teen, to designing and developing my own small-scale, and never finished video games today. I’m drawn to systems, iteration, and the satisfaction of seeing something I built come to life.</p>
                        <p>Outside of work, I’m either in the kitchen trying out new recipes or planning a trip. I’ve lived in Boston for over 10 years across several neighborhoods and still love it. New England has a lot to offer — beaches, hiking trails, islands, ski spots, and quick weekend escapes — which makes it easy to stay curious. I also try and travel abroad whenever I can and keep expanding my list of countries visited.</p>
